# PSPowerHour

## What is PowerHour?

Think of this like a virtual PowerShell User Group, with a lightning-demo format, and room for non-PowerShell-specific content.  Eight community members will give a demo each PowerHour.

### Where do we watch!

We'll be streaming on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHKcGei3EjxBNYQCFZ3WNQ)

### When's the next PowerHour?

We'll add an agenda at least a week ahead of each PowerHour.  To find the date and more details:

* Check for the latest [Agenda](Agenda.md)
* Sort for the most recent folder under materials:  For example, [materials/2018-08-21](materials/2018-08-21)
* Watch #PSPowerHour on Twitter

### How do I submit a proposal?

Just [submit an issue](https://github.com/PSPowerHour/PSPowerHour/issues/new)!
We need a title, your name, and a brief abstract — that's enough to get started!

Once you fill out an issue, we'll work with you on timing

### What should I talk about?

Anything!  Demo a module or function that you wrote, or that you use often.
Describe a helpful tip or trick that you think is worth sharing with the audience.
This is up to you!

Include info the audience will find helpful:

* What are you talking about?
* How does it work? This is a demo after all!
* Why might the audience use this?
* Where can they find more?

### What should I present with?

This is up to you!  _Demo_ doesn't mean _live demo only_

* Slides
* Slides with PowerShell on them
* The console
* VS Code
* PowerShell ISE
* Pre-recorded video that you narrate
* Notepad (maybe not)
* Something else

Zoom in so it just fits in the whole screen. Don't be shy.. Bigger is better!

### How long do I talk?

Anything under 10 minutes!
Don't try to fill the whole 10 minutes, only show us what we need to see — only have 5 minutes of material?
Even better!

Oh.  In case it's not clear: it's a hard limit on 10 minutes.
If you need more time, consider talking at a local or remote user group!

### When will I talk?

* We'll work with you in your GitHub issue proposal
* We'll try to give you a two week notice for the session you're scheduled to demo in
* We'll include an order-of-operations so you know your spot in line

### How are talks scheduled?

* We'll pick the 8 oldest, open proposals (only one talk per person)
* We'll review the timezones of the speakers and work to make sure they're scheduled in the most convenient / sensible way we can manage
* We'll do our best to make sure we won't have duplicate content _in the same PSPowerHour_.
  * There's tons of value in every speaker's individual take on a topic, but we want to get a good spread of topics each event.
    Just because a topic has been covered or touched on before doesn't make it a bad topic for a future talk!
* We'll do our best to randomize the order of speakers as much as possible while remaining mindful of and sensitive to timezones.
  * This is to ensure a spread of both speakers and topics, so we don't end up with a cluster of, for example, three related-topic-talks in a row.
  * We're also reserving the right to do a little serendipitous ordering to make demos that _are_ on related topics have a neat flow - so, for example, if one person is talking about 'what is Plaster' that talk goes before the 'tips and tricks for writing Plaster manifests' talk.

### What happens the day of?

* Have your materials ready to present!
* Show up 15 minutes early.
  We want to get everyone connected and make sure they can share their desktop and audio without issue
* Have fun!  Don't be too stressed.
  It's just a couple minutes, and you'll have other peers joining you

### Do I have to answer questions?

Nope!  At least, not live; no time for that.
We'll encourage the community to follow up with you via...

* The twitter URL you include
* #powerhour in powershell.slack.com
* The issue for your demo

It would be awesome if you follow up on community questions in one of these spots

### Can you get awesome-person-xyz to do a demo?

We'll certainly be pestering folks, but if you know someone who has something awesome to talk about them, point them here and ask them to [submit a proposal](https://github.com/PSPowerHour/PSPowerHour/issues/new)!

### Can I pre-record a demo?

This part is tough.
We'll try to figure something out.
Short term, we'll need folks to demo things in person

To clarify — you can record something, and discuss things while playing it during the stream — we just don't have tooling to add an entire pre-recorded demo (speaking and screencap) yet.
