# PSPowerHour

## What is PowerHour?

Think of this like a virtual PowerShell User Group, with a lightning-demo format, and room for non-PowerShell-specific content

### Where do we watch!

We'll be streaming on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHKcGei3EjxBNYQCFZ3WNQ)

### How do I submit a demo proposal?

Just [submit an issue](https://github.com/PSPowerHour/PSPowerHour/issues/new)!
We need a title, your name, and a brief abstract — that's enough to get started!

Once you fill out an issue, we'll work with you on timing

### What should I talk about?

Anything!  Demo a module or function that you wrote, or that you use often.
Describe a helpful tip or trick that you think is worth sharing with the audience.
This is up to you!

Include info the audience will find helpful:

* What are you talking about?
* How does it work? This is a demo after all!
* Why might the audience use this?
* Where can they find more?

### How long do I talk?

Anything under 10 minutes!
Don't try to fill the whole 10 minutes, only show us what we need to see — only have 5 minutes of material?
Even better!

Oh.  In case it's not clear: it's a hard limit on 10 minutes.
If you need more time, consider talking at a local or remote user group!

### When will I talk?

* We'll work with you in your GitHub issue proposal
* We'll try to give you a two week notice for the session you're scheduled to demo in
* We may occassionally hit a cut off and need to reschedule you for the next session
* We'll include an order-of-operations and indicate demos that may be at risk of being rescheduled

### How are talks scheduled?

* We'll pick the 10 oldest, open proposals (only one talk per person)
* We'll review the timezones of the speakers and work to make sure they're scheduled in the most convenient / sensible way we can manage
* We'll do our best to make sure we won't have duplicate content _in the same PSPowerHour_.
  * There's tons of value in every speaker's individual take on a topic, but we want to get a good spread of topics each event.
    Just because a topic has been covered or touched on before doesn't make it a bad topic for a future talk!
* We'll do our best to randomize the order of speakers as much as possible while remaining mindful of and sensitive to timezones.
  * This is to ensure a spread of both speakers and topics, so we don't end up with a cluster of, for example, three related-topic-talks in a row.
  * We're also reserving the right to do a little serendipitous ordering to make demos that _are_ on related topics have a neat flow - so, for example, if one person is talking about 'what is Plaster' that talk goes before the 'tips and tricks for writing Plaster manifests' talk.

### Rescheduled?  Why!

So!  Let's say we have an hour.
We ask folks for demos under 10 minutes.
Some of the best demos I've seen have been ~5 minutes.
If we schedule only 6 sessions (6 * 10 minutes = 1 hour), and we get a bunch of 5 minute demos, we'll miss out on the chance to have more demos!

On the other hand, if we assume a 6 minute average demo (10 * 6 minutes = 1 hour), if several of those demos go up to 10 minutes, we'll go a bit beyond the scheduled hour.

We'll try to keep this balanced, but there's always a chance that later sessions will be bumped. 
You'll get precedence at the next session.
We'll try to avoid this for folks making accomodations for our timezone (e.g. if you're demoing at midnight or 6:00 AM!)

### What happens the day of?

* Have your materials ready to present!
* Show up 15 minutes early.
  We want to get everyone connected and make sure they can share their desktop and audio without issue
* Have fun!  Don't be too stressed.
  It's just a couple minutes, and you'll have other peers joining you

### Do I have to answer questions?

Nope!  At least, not live; no time for that.
We'll encourage the community to follow up with you via...

* The twitter URL you include
* #powerhour in powershell.slack.com
* The issue for your demo

It would be awesome if you follow up on community questions in one of these spots

### Can you get awesome-person-xyz to do a demo?

We'll certainly be pestering folks, but if you know someone who has something awesome to talk about them, point them here and ask them to [submit a proposal](https://github.com/PSPowerHour/PSPowerHour/issues/new)!

### Can I pre-record a demo?

This part is tough.
We'll try to figure something out.
Short term, we'll need folks to demo things in person

To clarify — you can record something, and discuss things while playing it during the stream — we just don't have tooling to add an entire pre-recorded demo (speaking and screencap) yet.
