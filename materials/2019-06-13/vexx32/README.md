# PowerShell Magic: Argument Transformations

## Presenter

> Joel Sallow

## Abstract

> Ever had a function that seems to _need_ three or four parameter sets just to handle input appropriately?
>
> PowerShell Core, in its quest to cover _literally every base on the planet_ for your convenience, has provided a much more succinct and useful method.
>
> I'll be covering uses of `System.Management.Automation.ArgumentTransformationAttribute` and how to properly design your own transformation attributes.
